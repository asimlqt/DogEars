# DogEars

## Named bookmarks for sublime text

DogEars allows you to create Bookmarks inside your code, and give them names. It also allows you to search for them using a quick panel (like the Ctrl + P Dialog)

### What works:

* Create a bookmark (Ctrl + Shift + B) (you will need to enter a name)
* Access a bookmark (Ctrl + Shift + M) 
* Delete a bookmark (Ctrl + Shift + D) 

### What doesn't work(yet):

* The bookmarks aren't stored on your hard drive. If you close Sublime Text, the bookmarks are lost
* The bookmarks are still shown in case the section of text containing the bookmark has been deleted
* Stability issues
